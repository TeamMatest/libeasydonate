#+title: libeasydonate - a Rust wrapper for the EasyDonate API

* libeasydonate
libeasydonate was created for easy access to the [[https://easydonate.ru][EasyDonate]] API from Rust.
** HTTP клиенты
libeasydonate has a mechanism of adapting any asynchronous HTTP client for use with the API.
In the library, there is a builtin adapter for [[https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest][reqwest]] (with the feature flag "reqwest").
*** reqwest
Example usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
let easydonate_config = EasyDonateConfig {
    api_key: "<API key>".into()
};
let easydonate = EasyDonate::new(EasyDonateReqwest::new(easydonate_config));
// ... use the easydonate object ...
#+END_SRC
